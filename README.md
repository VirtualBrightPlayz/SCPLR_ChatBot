# SCP: Labrat Chat Bot example

Works on versions 1.94 to 1.96

## Credits

thamriyell gave us the idea for twitch integration.

this is an example. people can spam the shit out of the bot/api.

## Discord bot

place `token.txt` next to the exe/dll with nothing but the bot token in it.

## Twitch bot

https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/guide might prove useful.

place `token.txt` with the oauth token

place `login.txt` with your username in lowercase

place `channels.txt` with the irc channels for the bot to listen to (typically just lowercase username)
